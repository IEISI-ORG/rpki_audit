# APNIC-62 Presentation — Claims & Conclusions Verification Prompt

Use this prompt with Claude (or another LLM with access to the audit data) to systematically verify every factual assertion in `apnic62_presentation.md` before the talk.

---

## Instructions for the verifier

You are fact-checking the APNIC-62 presentation `apnic62_presentation.md` against the May 2026 rov_audit_v22 output. For each claim below, locate the authoritative source in the listed report file, confirm the number or statement matches, and flag any discrepancy. Where the claim is a technical assertion about RPKI/BGP protocol behaviour (not an audit statistic), evaluate it against RFC text or established operator practice.

Use this working directory: `/home/terry/rpki_audit/`

**Verdict for each claim:** ✅ Confirmed / ⚠️ Close but imprecise / ❌ Wrong / ❓ Not found in source

## Section VII — Technical / Protocol Claims

These are evaluated against RFC text and established BGP/RPKI practice, not the audit data.

| Claim | Slide | RFC / Reference |
|---|---|---|
| RPKI has three route states: Valid, Invalid, NotFound | 4, 5 | RFC 6811 §2 |
| ROV drops Invalid routes; NotFound routes pass | 5 | RFC 6811 §5, RFC 7115 |
| A more-specific prefix wins by longest-match regardless of RPKI state | 19 | BGP longest-prefix-match (RFC 4271) |
| Without a covering ROA, ROV provides no protection against more-specific hijacks | 19 | RFC 6811 + RFC 8893 |
| ASPA is built on top of ROV — a non-ROV provider cannot enforce ASPV | 33 | RFC 9589 §5 |
| Valley-free Gao-Rexford constraint: (c→p)* → (peer)? → (p→c)* | 8 | Gao-Rexford 2001, RFC 7908 |
| IXP route servers strip their ASN from AS-paths per RFC 7947 | 9 | RFC 7947 §2.2.2 |
| RFC 9582 = ASPA Objects, RFC 9589 = ASPV Algorithm | 30 | Check publication status |

## Section VIII — Consistency Checks (internal to the deck)

| Check | Slides |
|---|---|
| Glass House definition is consistent: ROV enforcer with unsigned own prefixes | 4, 5, 19, 37 |
| Quadrant Q3 "Glass Houses" (unsigned customer base) vs slide 19 "Glass Houses" (unsigned own prefixes) — confirm audience won't conflate | 16, 19 |
| SITV networks appear in both holdout table (non-ROV transit) and SITV slide — confirm verdicts match | 15, 20 |
| AS9304 HGC appears in both holdout table (#41, cone 5,182) and SITV table (cone 5,182, 100% signed) — confirm these are consistent | 15, 20 |
| CERNET cone cited as 3,859 downstream networks (ASPA context) vs AS38255 in China slide — confirm same entity | 28, 32 |
| China 34.8% traffic protected on slide 28 vs 62.7% exposed — confirm these sum to ~97.5% and the gap is PARTIAL/other | 28 |

## How to run this verification

```bash
cd /home/terry/rpki_audit
# Check a specific report file
cat reports/statistics.md | grep -A5 "CORE: ACTIVE"

# Spot-check impact score arithmetic (Lumen example)
python3 -c "print(73602 * 30138 / 1e9, 'Billion')"

# Check ASPA provider counts
python3 -c "
import json
data = json.load(open('data/downstream_graph.json'))
print('CERNET downstream count:', len(data.get('38255', [])))
"
```
