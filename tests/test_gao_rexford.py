Rigorous logic tests for the BGP topology pipeline.

BGP AS-path semantics (TABLE_DUMP2 format)
==========================================
A path is written  [PEER_0, ..., ORIGIN_N]  where:
  - PEER_0  is the AS nearest to the route collector (observer)
  - ORIGIN_N is the AS that originated the prefix

Data-plane traffic flows LEFT → RIGHT  (toward the origin/destination).
Route announcements flow   RIGHT → LEFT (origin propagates outward).

For any ASN X at position i in path [P0, P1, ..., Pn]:

  LEFT  neighbor  (i-1, toward collector)
        = the ASN that X forwarded the announcement TO
        = X's CUSTOMER or X's peer at the top of the path (data-plane downstream)

  RIGHT neighbor  (i+1, toward origin)
        = the ASN that X received the announcement FROM
        = X's PROVIDER or X's peer at the top of the path (data-plane upstream)

Tier 1s appear near the CENTER of a path (peak of the valley-free hill).
Stubs appear at the EDGES (leftmost or rightmost positions).

Gao-Rexford Valley-Free Constraint
====================================
A BGP path is valley-free if and only if it has the shape:

    (customer→provider)* → (peer↔peer)? → (provider→customer)*

Once the path starts going "downhill" (provider→customer), it can never go
"uphill" again (customer→provider).  That forbidden pattern is the "valley."

Topology inference rules (must match both cone-calculator.go and build_topology_from_go.py)
============================================================================================
Applied in this priority order:
  1. Non-transit ASNs (RIRs, root servers, IXP route servers) → skip (no cone)
  2. Tier 1 ↔ non-Tier-1 → Tier 1 is always provider (bypasses degree ratio)
  3. Tier 1 ↔ Tier 1    → peering link, drop
  4. degree(A) > 4×degree(B) → A is provider of B
  5. degree(B) > 4×degree(A) → B is provider of A
  6. otherwise           → peering link, drop
